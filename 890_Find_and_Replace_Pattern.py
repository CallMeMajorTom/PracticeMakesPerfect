#You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.
#
#A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
#
#(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)
#
#Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern.
#
#You may return the answer in any order.
#
#
#
#Example 1:
#
#Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
#Output: ["mee","aqq"]
#Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
#"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
#since a and b map to the same letter.
#
#
#Note:
#
#1 <= words.length <= 50
#1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20
