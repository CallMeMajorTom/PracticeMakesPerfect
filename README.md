#### GetNetDetail.py
Caffe have some pretrained Net like googleNet, alexNet and soon, we can finetune these models and use them to classify our dataset without spending lots of time and GPU. In our case, instead of using them, we are going to do some research about their structures, so we want to get all details of these models. Caffe offers some interfaces so we can get thoudsands of parameters or features of each layer easily, this script output these information into a file.
